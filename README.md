# event-alarms
Single page app that displays open 'events' or 'alarms'

## Requirements

1. Create a react app with Typescript. I am only expecting to see a single page. So no need for functional navigation or authentication. 
2. Assume you are creating a page that displays open ‘events’ or alarms. An example event model could look something like this:

    >
    Id: 1\
    type: “Assistance”\
    datetime: 1684477511\
    status: “active”\
    roomId: 12\
    residentId: 23
    >

    Feel free to add more if you think necessary. 

3. Mock the data in the front end. 
4. Think about how best to display the data, paying particular attention to the design and styling. 

Note that the requirements are intentionally vague, as I want you to get creative with it and implement patterns/structures that you think necessary. I wouldn’t expect you to spend any more than a few hours. If you do not finish, that is perfectly ok. We can walk through your progress on Monday. I would prefer to see a partial, but well thought out project than a complete but messy one!

## User Story

As a user, I want to be able to see all of my active alarms on a screen (by priority) so I can action them accordingly. 

Consider screen realestate, necessary information etc.
